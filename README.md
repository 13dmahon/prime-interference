# Prime Interference

A computational and geometric exploration of prime number structure via
small-prime interference fields.

This project models primes as **low-energy nodes** in a field generated by
the overlapping influence of small primes. The resulting structure exhibits:

- strong enrichment of primes in low-interference regions,
- geometric stability across ranges,
- predictive transfer to unseen intervals,
- visual structure on Ulam-style embeddings.

This is **experimental mathematics**: the code produces measurable,
reproducible phenomena, but does not claim analytic proofs.

## Core Idea (Plain English)

Small primes act like repeating waves across the number line.

When many such waves overlap:
- numbers with lots of small factors land in noisy regions,
- numbers avoiding small primes fall into quiet valleys.

Primes overwhelmingly appear in those quiet valleys.

This project quantifies, visualizes, and tests that phenomenon.
